                         Over the next five years, she began to plan out the seven books
                          of the series. She wrote mostly in longhand and amassed a mountain of notes
                          , many of which were on scraps of paper. 
    
                        She arrived in Edinburgh in 1993 with three chapters of Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone in her suitcase.
